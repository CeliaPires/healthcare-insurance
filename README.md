# Project Healthcare insurance cost analysis

## Project Healthcare insurance cost analysis aims to provide insights and predictive 
## reports for estimating healthcare insurance charges based on personal and geographic attributes.

# Dataset Content

## ## The dataset contains information on the relationship between personal attributes
## (age, gender, BMI, family size, smoking habits) and geographic factors and their impact
## on medical insurance charges. This data can be used to study how these features
## influence insurance costs and develop predictive reports for estimating healthcare
## expenses.

# Business Requirements

## Understand how personal attributes and geographic factors influence insurance
## costs and develop predictive models for estimating healthcare expenses. 

# Hypothesis and how to validate?

## Individuals outside of the normal range BMI will incur higher insurance costs
## Individuals who smoke will incur higher insurance costs than the non smoker individuals.
## Hypothesis to be validated through data visualisation

# Project Plan

## high-level steps for the analysis:
### Data cleansing (removing of duplicates, checking null values, data type of each
### columns)
### Creation of additional columns for data analysis (BMI category)
### Data visualisation
### Reporting and documentation

## How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
###  I used chatgpt guidance on the visualisation part and some of the coding for the data transformation. Started putting together a checklist to use on my next project. 

## Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?
### Since this was my first time, I needed some guidance on how best to approach the
### project from extracting, cleansing, transforming the data and the visualisation part.
### Using chatgpt was of immense help. I intend to use the checklist I have started
### compiling on my next project.

# The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations

## business requirements and rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations
### I took the business requirements from the project brief. On the data visualisation
### part, used ChatGPT to give me insights on how best to visualise them. 

# Analysis techniques used
## Data cleansing (removing of duplicates, checking null values, data type of each
## columns).

## How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
### Before starting on the cleansing part, viewed the file in Excel (google sheets) to get
### a sense of how much cleansing the file needed. From there could see a few things that
### needed fixing and it also gave me ideas of additional columns needed to assist with
### the data analysis and visualisation. I think it is good to view the file outside of
### vs code just to get a feel of how much cleansing a file will need.

## Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these
## challenges?
### No, the file had all the data that I needed. There were no limitations.

## How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code
## optimisation?
### I used chatgpt extensively, throughout the project for guidance and
### troubleshooting. I am able to understand the code produced by chatgpt which means I
### understand the basics of Python coding.

# Ethical considerations

## Were there any data privacy, bias or fairness issues with the data?
### I did not spot any issues with the data or concerns with bias/fairness. In terms of
### GDPR the file did not contain any identifiable personal data. Had it been the case, I
### would have had to adhere GDPR legislation.

## How did you overcome any legal or societal issues?
### There were no legal or societal issues to address.

# Unfixed Bugs

## There are no unfixed bugs to report on.

## Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
### This first project was a big learning curve for me as it highlighted gaps in my
### knowledge and understanding. Thus, why I decided to compile a checklist to use for
### future projects. Having support from my group and the other students alongside the
### SMEs was what made it possible for me to complete this project.

# Development Roadmap

## What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these
## challenges?
### As I had gaps in my knowledge and understanding on how to set-up a project in VS
### Code, attending daily hurdles with my group, compiling a checklist and learning from
### others queries. Also made used of the Slack channel for more technical support. 

## What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience?
### Between now and the next project, I intend to finalise my data cleanse checklist and
### transformation (have all the codes listed for future reference). In terms of
### visualisation, I need to research more all the different graphs that are available and
### which ones are best used and when.

# Main Data Analysis Libraries

## List of libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, pyplot, seaborn, plotly. 
## Pls refer to VS Code on how these libraries were used through out the project. 

# Credits

## Chatgpt for coding, visualisation and troubleshooting
## LMS for data cleansing
## For the categorisation of the BMI data, used :

# Acknowledgements

## I would like to thank my group for their guidance and support: Natalie, Bosco,
## Mohammad
## The other students; Andrei and Ronnie
## The SMEs: Mark and John
## Emma for her encouragement and guidance
## None of this would have been possible without them!!
